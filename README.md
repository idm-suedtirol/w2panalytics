# BZAnalytics

BZAnalytics (http://analytics.mobility.bz.it) is a [free software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) on-line application and is developed under [AGPL License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html)
* [City of Bolzano/Bozen](http://www.gemeinde.bozen.it/) project [intergreen](http://www.integreen-life.bz.it/) 
* [TIS innovation park South Tyrol](http://www.tis.bz.it) 
* ***web design*** [Made In Cima](http://www.madeincima.it) 
* ***developed by*** [Ethical Software](http://www.ethicalsoftware.it)


The application shows the differents data retrieved by detectors present at Bolzano through a statistic graph or a map of the city. There are differents tipology of data like: 

-Bluetooth.

-Traffic.

-Weather.

-Environment.

-Pollution.

## Where to find documentation:
The documents of the API can be found on: 

http://ipchannels.integreen-life.bz.it/doc/

More technical info about hardware installation of the API can be found on:

## How to change the software language?
BZ Analytics is a multi-language software introduced in English, German and Italian (directory: static/js/jquery-multilang/lang/DE.js; EN.js; and IT.js). On the first access the software catches the browser language and settings the relative cookie that the user can change through the "Dropdown menu" on the upper right side of the window. The language of BZAnalytics application is manged through these files:

-static/js/jquery-multilang/lang_login.js for the Log-in page

-static/js/jquery-multilang/lang.js for other pages

## Graph creation
Through the Sidebar presents in the graphic tab the users can select a tipology, a source and a station to display the statistic data of the detectors through a graph. The application use the select.js library (https://select2.github.io/) for generate the selects and the static/graph.js file for retrieve the data by the server(Ajax call).


## LPLOT
The graph is managed through the static/lpolt.js file.
More on [here](http://www.flotcharts.org/)

## How does the MAP work?


On the left sidebar of the map we have differents link-stations that actives the Javascript code in the map.html file. When the Javascript code is called, all stations associated with a tipology is recovered through Ajax call to the Web2py Server and reports in the map under makers. See for example  in the map.html:

-load_geojson_bluetooth()

-load_geojson_traffic()

-load_geojson_parking() 

-load_geojson_env()

N.B. Web2py server returns the data in GeoJSON format.

The data associated with a station is showing to the user through a popup that allows to switch to the graphic tab for seeing the data in a statistic graph.
The Web2py Application retrieves the data through the Integreen API:


Bluetooth stations: 
-http://ipchannels.integreen-life.bz.it/BluetoothFrontEnd/

Parking stations: 
-http://ipchannels.integreen-life.bz.it/parkingFrontEnd/ 

These links provide all necessary informations about the presence of Bluetooth stations and  Parking slots in Bolzano. With these API we can retrieve meta-data of stations,  data from a specific station, data in time-frame from a specific station and lastly the date of the last record.
The markers are shown in 2 different colors based on the value of the field "last value" for each stations. If the last value is almost 75% of the biggest last value of all stations the color is full otherwise is transparent.
When is not possible to retrieve the data from the WebServer this last return the field "last value" with value -1 and in this case the markers are inserts in the map with a gray popup color.

Weather: http://ipchannels.integreen-life.bz.it/MeteoFrontEnd/

The above mentioned link provides all the necessary information to estimate the weather situation in Bolzano. The API contains information about the pressure measured in pascal, the wind velocity in m/s, the percentage of the air humidity, sunshine duration, wind directions, air temperature, wind velocity squall, sun radiation and lastly the precipitation. 

Remember:


1)All the informations are retrieved through AJAX calls to WEB2PY

2)The Map is built thanks to a open source JavaScript library called LEAFLET. More on [geojson](http://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson.html)

3)Some stations use a different feature offered by LEAFLET such as “TileLayer”  : Stations Pollution, PM10 Dispersion, NO2 Dispersion, PM10 Emissions, NOx Emissions, CO2 Emissions, Journey time and Probe vehicles

## Prerequisites
* ***JQUERY/JSON***
All the information retrieved from integreen API are in JSON format and retrieved through AJAX calls. Therefore basic knowledge of [JSON](http://www.json.org) is required.

* ***WEB2PY/PYTHON***
In BZ Analytics we acquire and manipulate the data (coming from the API) through the Web2py open source framework.
Useful resources can be th [introduction to web2py](http://www.web2py.com/book/default/chapter/01) and the [introduction to python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide).

## Installation
* ***WEB SERVER***
Download and install an open source web application framework written in the Python programming language such as [WEB2PY](https://http://www.moneo.si/examples/download), you can choose a compatible version to install. 

* ***SOURCE CODE ON GITHUB***
Download the [project source code](https://github.com/tis-innovation-park/w2panalytics) and the supporter application [vtraffic](https://github.com/ilvalle/vtraffic)
unzip the downloaded files into the application directory of the web2py web server.

ENJOY THE FUTURE!
